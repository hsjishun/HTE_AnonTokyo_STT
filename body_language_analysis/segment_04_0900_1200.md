### 09:00 — Recap and Instructions
**Posture:** The teacher is standing upright near a student table, slightly leaning towards the students she is addressing.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** She holds a presentation clicker in one hand and uses her other hand to gesture slightly downwards, indicating the "graphic organizer" the students should have out.
**Facial Expressions:** Her expression is focused and attentive, maintaining eye contact with the students in front of her to ensure they are following instructions.
**Movement/Positioning:** She is positioned at the front-side of the room, near the student groups, establishing proximity.
**Interaction Style:** Her body language is direct and instructional, reinforcing her verbal cue to look at their organizers.
**Pedagogical Significance:** This establishes focus, sets clear expectations for the upcoming segment, and signals to students that they need to be prepared to actively follow along.

### 09:12 — The "Spaghetti Bowl" Analogy
**Posture:** Standing straight, with a more open and dynamic stance.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** She uses a highly descriptive, illustrative gesture. She forms a bowl shape with both hands, brings them together, and slightly wiggles her fingers to represent a "spaghetti bowl of loose DNA." She then brings her hands closer together to visually demonstrate the concept of "condensation."
**Facial Expressions:** Her face is animated and expressive, matching the vivid analogy she is using.
**Movement/Positioning:** She begins to pace slowly from the side table towards the center of the room.
**Interaction Style:** She uses physical analogies to make abstract, microscopic concepts concrete and understandable.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Enhances student comprehension by providing a relatable visual anchor for the term "condense."

### 09:30 — Emphasizing Key Phrases
**Posture:** She comes to a stop and stands relatively still to deliver a specific point.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** She makes small, precise chopping motions with the hand holding the clicker to emphasize the distinct words in the phrase, "chromatin condenses into chromosomes."
**Facial Expressions:** Her expression becomes more serious and deliberate, signaling that this is important information to capture.
**Movement/Positioning:** She is standing near a group of students, looking down at them as she delivers this concise summary.
**Interaction Style:** Her body language shifts from illustrative to emphasizing, distilling complex information into a simple, memorable phrase.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Highlights key takeaways for note-taking, helping students differentiate between explanatory analogies and core facts they need to memorize.

### 09:44 — Explaining Cohesins
**Posture:** She adopts a walking posture, leaning slightly forward as she moves across the front.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** When discussing "cohesins," she brings both hands together and slightly interlocks her fingers, physically demonstrating how these proteins hold the chromatin arms together.
**Facial Expressions:** Engaging and looking up, scanning the whole class as she moves.
**Movement/Positioning:** She walks past the student tables back towards the front desk area.
**Interaction Style:** Her dynamic movement keeps attention, and her gesture perfectly mirrors the biological function she is describing.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Maintains classroom presence and utilizes gestures to clearly explain protein function, aiding visual learners.

### 10:07 — The Nucleolus Disappearing
**Posture:** Standing behind the front desk, facing the classroom.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** She uses a broad, two-handed outward expanding motion, followed by a slight dispersing movement with her fingers to illustrate the nucleolus breaking down or "disappearing." She briefly handles an object on the desk while talking.
**Facial Expressions:** Animated, visually representing the breakdown process.
**Movement/Positioning:** Front and center of the class, acting as the focal point.
**Interaction Style:** She uses her body to visualize the dissolution of cellular structures.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Makes invisible cellular processes visible through physical enactment, helping students conceptualize structural changes.

### 10:20 — Using a Physical Model
**Posture:** Standing actively next to the whiteboard, turning her body slightly to reference the board and the class.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** She picks up a physical, manipulatable model (representing a chromosome) and holds it up for the class to see. She points to different parts of it with her other hand while explaining the spindle's function. She also points specifically towards a student (Erasmo) when recalling a previous point he made.
**Facial Expressions:** Engaging, making direct eye contact, particularly when referencing the specific student.
**Movement/Positioning:** Front of the room, near the projected presentation.
**Interaction Style:** Incorporating physical props to demonstrate a concept and physically validating student input by pointing to them.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Employs multiple modalities (visual projection, physical prop, verbal explanation) to reinforce learning. Acknowledging a student's prior contribution via pointing builds classroom community and validates student participation.

### 10:40 — Summarizing Prophase Events
**Posture:** Standing square to the class, grounded in the center.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** She uses a subtle counting or listing motion, employing slight downward chops with her hand to separate the four key events of prophase as she lists them. When reviewing the disappearance of the envelope, she makes a circular "capsule" shape with her hands.
**Facial Expressions:** Focused and deliberate, ensuring the class is following the summary.
**Movement/Positioning:** Front center, ensuring she is visible to all students.
**Interaction Style:** Structuring the verbal review visually through distinct hand movements.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Helps students organize and chunk the information into distinct, memorable points, aiding in review and note-taking.

### 11:08 — Checking for Understanding
**Posture:** Relaxed, weight shifted slightly, scanning the room.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** Open posture, hands are relatively still by her side or holding the clicker loosely.
**Facial Expressions:** Inquiring, looking around the room, making eye contact with various groups to see who is still writing.
**Movement/Positioning:** Front center.
**Interaction Style:** Pausing her instruction to observe the class's body language in return.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Demonstrates responsiveness to student pacing. Her open posture and scanning invite questions and show she is waiting for them to catch up.

### 11:25 — Explaining the Diagram
**Posture:** Turned partially sideways to face the whiteboard while keeping her body open enough to address the students.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** Uses the clicker specifically as a pointer to identify parts of the projected diagram (spindles, envelope). She briefly re-uses the circular "spaghetti bowl" gesture to connect back to the previous analogy.
**Facial Expressions:** Explanatory, looking back and forth between the slide and the students.
**Movement/Positioning:** Standing right next to the projected image on the board.
**Interaction Style:** Guiding visual attention directly to the relevant parts of the diagram while explaining them verbally.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Teaches visual literacy by connecting terminology to specific visual representations, ensuring students know exactly what they are looking at in the "cartoonish version."

### 11:45 — Introducing Prometaphase
**Posture:** Upright, moving slightly laterally.
**Hand/Arm Gestures:** Gestures with the clicker hand. When explaining that the process "continues," she uses small rolling or forward-moving hand motions to indicate ongoing action (condensation).
**Facial Expressions:** Engaging and conversational.
**Movement/Positioning:** Pacing slightly back and forth near the front center.
**Interaction Style:** Smoothly transitioning to new material with gestures that indicate continuation and progression.
**Pedagogical Significance:** Links previously learned knowledge to new, more advanced concepts (Prometaphase), using physical gestures to represent the ongoing, continuous nature of the cell cycle phases.
