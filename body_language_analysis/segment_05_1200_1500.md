Here is a detailed analysis of the teacher's nonverbal communication and body language from 12:00 to 15:00 in the provided video:

### 12:00 - 12:20 — Illustrating Cellular Breakdown

*   **Posture:** The teacher stands upright with an active and engaged posture at the front of the classroom. Her weight is evenly distributed, suggesting readiness to explain complex material.
*   **Hand/Arm Gestures:** She begins with her hands held close together, then slowly pulls them apart to physically illustrate the concept of the "nuclear envelope starting to come apart." Shortly after, she uses outward, sweeping hand gestures on either side of her body to depict centrosomes "starting to appear" on each side of the cell. She holds a presentation clicker in her left hand throughout.
*   **Facial Expressions:** Her expression is focused and serious as she delivers the technical information. She maintains continuous eye contact with different sections of the room, scanning the students as they take notes.
*   **Movement/Positioning:** She is stationary at the front of the room, standing slightly to the right of the projection screen, maintaining a clear line of sight to all students.
*   **Interaction Style:** Her gestures directly mirror the verbal concepts she is explaining. By physically acting out "coming apart" and "appearing on sides," she creates a visual anchor for the abstract biological processes.
*   **Pedagogical Significance:** This strong use of illustrative gestures helps translate microscopic, abstract concepts into tangible, visual movements, aiding student comprehension and retention. Her scanning eye contact ensures students are keeping pace with the new information.
