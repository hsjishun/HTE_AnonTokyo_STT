Based on a careful review of the specified segment from 36:00 to 36:28, it is impossible to provide the requested analysis of the teacher's body language, posture, gestures, facial expressions, and physical positioning.

**This is because the teacher is not visible on screen at any point during this timeframe.**

During this specific 28-second segment, the visual focus of the video is entirely on the students:
*   **36:00 - 36:04:** The camera is positioned on a group of students sitting around a lab table, working on their assignments.
*   **36:04 - 36:18:** The camera zooms in for an extreme close-up on a single student's notebook and hands as they draw a diagram of cell division.
*   **36:18 - 36:28:** The camera pulls back to a medium shot of the students at the table as they follow the verbal instructions to pack up their materials.

While the teacher's voice is heard providing positive reinforcement and closing instructions ("I'm so glad to see everybody modeling really, really well..."), her physical presence is completely off-camera. Therefore, an analysis of her physical nonverbal communication cannot be conducted for this clip.
