## 1. FULL TRANSCRIPT

[00:00] Teacher: All right, any other questions before we move on to mitosis? Excellent. Okay, so what we're going to do now is we're going to kind of put aside our um notes on that and we're going to get out our graphic organizer on the cell, the steps rather, the steps to mitosis. So it's this graphic organizer right here, and it's double-sided, and it says mitosis modeling diagrams. So this is what we're going to be using for the rest of class today. And like I said you're going to be working in pairs. You've got some materials on your table. I'll explain to you what they are and what we're going to do with them.
[00:38] Teacher: But first we're going to take about 10 minutes to talk a little bit about these phases. Did she get one? Everybody get one? Everybody has one, yeah? Um, so we're going to start to talk a little bit about the phases and I want you to, I know you took this in your notes, but I want you to jot some stuff down here. Okay, because in a little bit with your partner you're going to do some modeling and you're going to, you're going to draw what you see. So we're going to, we're going to capture some information about the steps to mitosis on the left, on the right side, and then we're going to be drawing on, err, yeah, we're going to be drawing on the left side. All right, so give me a second, I'm going to switch my PowerPoint really quickly. And we are going to begin talking about, oh the slideshow, about this. Sorry, my throat is really dry, I have to...
[01:28] Teacher: Okay. Are you guys ready? 
[01:31] Student: Yes.
[01:32] Teacher: Yes?
[01:34] Student: Are there supposed to be two prophases?
[01:38] Teacher: Oh my gosh. Human error. There's not supposed to be two prophases. How did that happen? So prophase, prometaphase. What's on the back? 
[01:49] Student: Metaphase.
[01:50] Teacher: Metaphase, anaphase, telophase, cytokinesis. Oh, okay. Well, it's just extra space for you to have. Thank you for pointing that out, Valentina. 
[01:58] Teacher: All right, so we're going to talk about cellular reproduction, mitosis, and cytokinesis. How many of you have ever learned this in your life? Like show me the... raise your hand if you've learned the steps to mitosis in your life. Okay, thank goodness. I don't see Alfredo, you never learned this? You did? Okay, I didn't see it.
[02:18] Teacher: So we've all learned about this, right? You saw it in seventh grade, you saw it in eighth grade, you saw it in ninth grade. Nothing has changed since then. All right, so that's a good thing. Um, I keep telling you that the unit, this unit is a little bit more um, just comfortable, and you're going to see why. Sure. She doesn't believe me, Valentina doesn't believe me. 
[02:38] Teacher: All right, so let's talk a little bit about eukaryotic cell reproduction. And if you um I know you got your graphic organizer from yesterday. The smallest part of a cell cycle, the less, the least amount of time, the less um volume I would say of like a pie chart, would be mitosis, right, the mitotic phase. And so this is when the cell actually divides. All of the work, the hard work, was already being done in S1, in G1, S, and G2. And so um this is just really taking everything that we did, all of our work that the cell did at the beginning in interphase, and then just kind of dividing it up, right. Divvying it up into two new daughter cells. 
[03:18] Teacher: But it's really important because we get genetically identical daughter cells. So maybe in that extra space that you have at the top where it's prophase twice, you can add that really important note. So that's something that I really want you guys to have as a driving key point is that the daughter cells are genetically identical. So I know you probably wrote this down already in your notes, but I really, there's no harm in doing it again. Daughter cells are genetically identical. So you're making this connection back to 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade, 9th grade when you learned all these things. Hopefully that's something that your teacher made sure to make a point of. 
[03:54] Teacher: But if not, I want you to make sure that you um can really really take this with you. Because when we talk about other types of cell division, we don't have um so much ident- identical cells. So when we talk about meiosis, um which is the reproduction of the gametes, of the reproductive cells, we don't have identical cells. And that's a good thing right, otherwise we would all look the same in this room. So because we look different, we'll talk about meiosis later. But mitosis makes it so that we all have the same structure of our ears and our our arms and our legs and our fingers, and that's what mitosis does. It keeps us um a little bit more normed as humans.
[04:37] Teacher: So we've got unicellular and multicellular mitosis. And we're going to focus on um we are multicellular organisms right, and so in unicellular organisms we have cell division that um makes a copy. But in multicellular organisms we have cell division that we use for growth, for repair, to make new organisms from a fertilized egg. So here's something else you can add in that first box, is that we undergo multicellular mitosis, and also that it's for these purposes. It's for growth, it's for repair, and it's for new formation of an organism. And that's a big big part of why we are so complex.
[05:17] Teacher: So chromosomes are something that we've also already discussed. We've discussed how DNA is wrapped up and it's packed up into these um really amazing packages in this double helix that I've shown you before, and I'll bring out again. We've got this really great organization, right? Um and it's got proteins, it's got histones, it's got all these great things that help package like 10 feet of DNA into one cell. Um but we're going to talk about what happens when that DNA comes apart, what happens when it unravels. So that's what we will focus on today. So we know that the DNA is coiled up, we know that it's really well organized so that we don't lose any integrity of it, and we don't lose any information, but we're going to talk about when we have to um divide it and separate it. 
[06:04] Teacher: So in your um little cups that you have, you've got some pipe cleaners, you've got some plastic cups, and you've got some beads. So if you would with your partner really quickly, find me a pair... make me one chromosome. Make me one whole chromosome with your partner. So make me one whole chromosome.
[06:23] Teacher: Make me one whole chromosome, yeah. Those are chromatids. So each individual pipe cleaner is a chromatid. Show me a chromosome with your partner. So... perfect. You can use a bead to represent the centromere. You can do whatever you want for right now, it doesn't matter to me. Show me a chromosome. Show me a chromosome really quickly. What does that look like? You can use beads to help you with the centromeres. Perfect. Let me see. Isaac, you guys... so if you don't already know, Isaac and Sean have already created their first chromosome.
[07:00] Student: Oh wow.
[07:01] Teacher: Yeah, that was quick. Here you go. Thank you guys. 
[07:04] Teacher: Okay perfect. So you're going to get to play with these a lot more in just a moment. Excellent, the ladies here have two chromosomes, and Cassidy used an old-fashioned way that I would, just kind of intertwine them, and Sophia used a little bead to show that centromere. So what do we have? Um let's just do some really quick identification. Uh, chromatids versus chromosomes. So will you show me, will you guys uh with with your partner, will you make them now just the chromatids? So show me the chromatids. There you go, undo them, yes. All you're doing is you're removing that chromosome pair and you're making some chromatids. Perfect. So you've got your chromatids. Excellent. Thank you. Dana's got both of hers in one hand. Perfect. Osvaldo, where's your chromatids? There you go, thank you. 
[07:51] Teacher: Okay. So chromatids versus chromosomes. Um, that's important to understand and that's an important thing to understand in mitosis. A chromatid is a single... right? It's a single strand, it's a single piece. And when we put them together we have a chromosome. So chromatids is a single versus chromosome it's two of them put together, right? Two pieces of this DNA. And so we've got that centromere that's holding them together, which is what your bead is representing, and it's makes it so that they're easily removed. Did you guys have a hard time um forming or separating your chromosomes? No, right, it was really easy. Well that's the whole purpose of the reason why we have chromatids created the way they are and put together the way they are to make a chromosome. It's because we need to separate them easily.
[08:41] Teacher: So as we go through let's look at the phases. So I want you in your own words and your own understanding and your own summary, let's talk really quickly about what happens during prophase. And we're going to jot it down in our graphic organizer, and then we are going to um do a quick uh just a a recap of what's happening in each phase. So you should have that graphic organizer out. 
[09:05] Teacher: So what's happening in prophase? So one, chromatin fibers condense. What does that mean? That means that we are going from this spaghetti bowl of loose DNA and we're starting to create this beautiful, organized structure that we have that is the chromosome that you guys created. So we've got that's one quick sentence that you can use. Chromatin condenses to form a chromosome. So if I had to take all of these words, because it's a lot of words, I would just write "chromatin condenses into chromosomes." Easy, quick, short, to the point. Chromatin condenses into chromosomes. 
[09:44] Teacher: You've got these really cool organ- like... I guess they're like organelles, or they're like um uh I don't know how we would classify them, but they're called cohesins, they're like proteins, uh I think they're proteins. And they they hold the chromatin arms together. We've got the nucleus, or the nucleoli, that disappears. So we've got that that really um important kind of vessel that's keeping everything protected um, and it's be- being removed. 
[10:19] Teacher: And then we form the spindle. So that's another big thing that happens. The spindle forms. And that spindle is going to be important, and that's what we talked about um Erasmo talked about it when we talked about G2. And how it's an important piece because it's what's going to separate these chromatids from each other, this chromosome is going to get separated into two. So we've got chromatin condensing into chromosomes, we've got cohesins that are holding things together, we've got the disappearance of that shelter or that that um capsule that's keeping everything inside, and then we've got that spindle that's forming. And once we've got all of that set up then we can go ahead and start moving our genetic information. So that was prophase. Does anybody need more time with this slide? You've got these in your notes too, so we're just kind of um capturing and transferring our thoughts a little bit into a better organized way. Shorter, more concise, right. Cool, okay. Anybody need this anymore?
[11:22] Teacher: All right, let's go on. So this is what prophase looks like in a like cartoonish version. Right, we've got the spindles that are starting to form, so our DNA is kind of all like in a spaghetti bowl but it's starting to condense. You've got this envelope around here, the nucleoli that's starting to break down, and then you've got the spindles that are forming right outside and they're ready. 
[11:42] Teacher: Um we have an in-between phase that maybe you didn't focus on too much in your 9th-grade biology class, that we give a little bit more depth to in AP Bio, and that's prometaphase. Prometaphase is we just continue the movement. Continue the condensation into chromosomes, continue the removal of that nuclear envelope. And so that nuclear envelope starts to come apart and we can't see it anymore. The centrosomes that are on each side of the cell are starting to appear. Um we've got the mitochondria, I'm sorry, the microtubules that are starting to show up as well. So here we've got a lot of like staging, a lot of physical structures that are getting either out of the way or they are getting into place. So we've gotten rid of the nuclear envelope, we've gotten the microtubules, they're taking their place so they can start dividing stuff and moving stuff. And we've got these kinetochores. And so the kinetochores basically what they're going to do is they're going to help to kind of reel in those sister chromatids as they're being separated. So the kinetochore microtubules attach to each other and they're going to start moving stuff. So they're all structural. So in prometaphase we have a lot of structural pieces that are coming into place. Okay.
[13:06] Teacher: Make sure to leave that left side blank, I know some of you are drawing which is great, leave some space in there so that you can draw what you model with your partner today. Okay. Prometaphase. Are we cool on this? Does anybody need any more, any more time with this slide? So big, big takeaways, structural stuff right. No more nuclear envelope. Structural kinetochores, microtubules are getting ready to separate things. Perfect. All right, are we good? Yes? Cool. 
[13:37] Teacher: Okay, that's what it looks like in a electron scanning microscope. You can start to see those poles forming, you can start to see those spindles kind of getting into place. Um here's another view of these non-kinetochore microtubules. In other words, these are the ones that are they're going to, they're kind of free and they're ready to start keeping that the cell, giving it some shape, getting ready for the next phase. 
[13:59] Teacher: Next phase is metaphase. Metaphase is the longest phase of mitosis. And this is where our double-stranded chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. So this is the phase that I think most students remember because everything's right in the middle. So you've got some great bullet points here to guide you. Um, longest phase, chromosomes line up. Period. Like, nothing more than that. And we sometimes call it the equatorial plate um or the metaphase plate. There's lots of different views here for you to see. We've got this kind of cartoonish diagram, we've got some real microscopic images, we've got this other like version that uses like different energies to show you um how everything is starting to organize. But in short we've got this nice lining up. And this is going to be really important because this is going to allow for there to be um kind of like a an equity or um a symmetry in the cell and in the chromosomes. Cool. All right.
[15:05] Teacher: Are we ready to go on? Almost done, anaphase. Anaphase. Oh there's a lot in this slide, but we can just condense that. In anaphase this is the basics for this guys, is the chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles. So our sister chromatids are pulled away from each other and they're moving away to each of the poles and the spindles are the ones that are grabbing them and pulling them. And I always think in my mind, ever since I've learned this, is anaphase away. And I always think about the sister chromatids and they're kind of bent and they um, and I I've I've said this before like in another class, I think in anatomy, but it reminds me the chromosomes are, the chromatids are like this. I always think of anaphase away and they're sisters, right? So I'm like "no sister don't leave me, don't go!" They're pulling, being forced apart from your sister. You don't want to leave them, well some of you might want to, but in this case we don't want them they they... that's what reminds me of how the structure of the chromatid is and they're going away from each other and they're like "no, don't let please don't leave me!" But they are, they have to be separated because we need identical daughter cells. So that's our anaphase. Um chromosomes, chromatids are pulled to opposite poles, and the spindles are pulling them. All right. 
[16:20] Teacher: Any questions so far? I've been going kind of quick and I didn't haven't stopped to ask you any questions. Again, I know that you're comfortable with this, I know you know this. You've known this for some time now, so. 
[16:30] Teacher: All right. Lastly, so we can finish it up, is our um telophase and our cytokinesis. So in telophase, that's when we have our last kind of movement. Our structures are, are coming to uh a place where they're going to kind of reorganize to make our two new daughter cells. So our two daughter nuclei are there, they they reappear. Um the nuclear envelopes come back, so we're getting ready to provide that kind of capsule, encapsulation around this this cell and the genetic information. And then our chromosomes go back to this unwound spaghetti bowl type of organization. They're no longer condensed in these nicely tightly packed coiled chromosomes, they're starting to just kind of let their hair down again and let loose again. Um, and they're getting ready to go back to the way they started. To go back to the way the cell started before we divided it. So telophase, two daughter cells, uh their nuclei are forming, the envelope returns, and the chromosomes unwind again, they go back to that kind of relaxed phase, yeah. 
[17:42] Student: So like the normal stage or like style of the cell's DNA is not winded like that? 
[17:51] Teacher: Yep, exactly. That's a great question. Did you guys hear Valentina's question? So then she's asking, is the DNA normally in just this unwound, unkept, unorganized state? Yes, it is. Why? Because when we are replicating it, we need it to be accessible. And if it's all tightly wound up, we're not going to be able to get to it. mRNA is not going to be able to be um copied as easily. It's not going to be able to be unwound as easily. So it is in a relaxed state. Yeah. 
[18:18] Student: So then when it says that in G1 and S that the DNA uncoils, what is that? 
[18:23] Teacher: So it means that it is in its... it's still in that stage. It's trying to let you know that it's in that un... it's not uncoiling, but it's just uncoiled. 
[18:31] Student: It's uncoiled. 
[18:32] Teacher: It's uncoiled. It continues to be uncoiled. But if we use that as our starting phase, if we use G1 as like our start, we have to say we're going to start with uncoiled DNA, and then in S phase we do the replication, and then in G1 phase we get the structural stuff ready, and then we coil it up. So yeah, that's a great question. Go ahead. 
[18:50] Teacher: Um, so we've got that unwinding. Lastly, and so here's what that nice cartoon picture looks like. Lastly we are in cytokinesis. So what is cytokinesis? Cytokinesis is simply the total division of each of these cells and they're going into their daughter cells. Um they're making their, they're finding their own freedom, they're becoming their unique cells, and that's what happens in cytokinesis. We've got the cytoplasm literally splitting. So cyto for cytoplasm and kinesis is for moving or for movement or for separation. So that's really it that happens in cytokinesis. That um you have complete separation of the cytoplasm. 
[19:32] Teacher: And so what's really interesting to find out about cytokinesis in animals is that if they don't fully separate, they if that cytokinesis does not happen, you're going to get um what we call a a multinucleated cell. This means that we're going to have a cell in an animal, it's less frequent, um that doesn't ha- that does not have that complete furrow. It doesn't completely separate. Um it happens a little bit more regularly in things like algae and plants and fungi, but in humans it doesn't necessarily happen very often. And so that's when we get um a cell that's going to be kind of like a two cells lumped together, which is interesting. 
[20:11] Teacher: In algae you can see it's got a cell wall so it looks a little bit different. Um in other plants, again you can see how there's a little bit of a difference in the way that the cytokinesis actually occurs in plant cells. But in animals this is our beautiful uh cell that's got that cleavage furrow. That little division point there. And everybody's like "oh it looks like a peach or looks like a butt." Um, yes it's okay to laugh at that. That is what it looks like and that's a good way for you to remember what it looks like. 
[20:40] Teacher: Um all right, questions on cytokinesis or on anything about mitosis in these steps that we just went through in the last 15 minutes? We'll talk a little bit more about, we'll talk all about DNA replication um coming up tomorrow and next week. 
[20:58] Teacher: So let's talk about our activity. So we've got a good 15 minutes that we can work together with our partners and we can kind of bring everything to a close and really understand what's happening here. So, you've got these materials. Now I'm not going to tell you what to do with them. I'm just going to give you the materials, I'm going to highlight what you have, and then I'm going to let you work with your partner. 
[21:20] Teacher: So you've got two cups. Why two? I don't know, you decide what you're going to do with these two cups. You have eight pieces of pipe cleaner. They're different colors. That might mean something as well for you. That might be a clue. And then you've got four beads. And these are going to be... well I'm not going to tell you what you're going to do with the beads. You're going to do something with them. 
[21:46] Teacher: So what I would like for you to do with your table partner is I'd like for you to model every single step of the mitotic phase or phases rather. I want you to use all the materials given to you. So you're going to have to figure out how to use them. I will be walking around. I see you guys are already formulating a plan. I will be walking around checking with you. 
[22:08] Teacher: Here's the caveat really quickly before you get started: please draw every single step that you model. And you will have enough time to do that and also for us to close up our discussion today. So go ahead and get started. I'm going to walk around and see what you're doing with your materials and uh you let me know what you're doing. Yes.
[22:30] Student: Can we get some more pipe cleaners? We have a little short one. 
[22:31] Teacher: You're missing a pipe cleaner, I'm so sorry, I will get you one.
[22:32] Student: It's like that.
[22:33] Teacher: Oh, it's gonna be a a another color... there you go. All right, let's go. Let's see what we're doing here.
[22:42] Student 1: So in the first one it's condensing into chromosomes. So some of them will start like... getting together. I don't have... not all of... I have this one. So some of them would start condensing. 
[22:58] Student 2: She needs two.
[22:59] Student 1: No wait, they're showing me two separate ones because like...
[23:02] Teacher: So you're gonna show... you're gonna draw...
[23:04] Student 1: I don't think so...
[23:09] Student 2: Oh yeah. Because then we can show that they...
[23:15] Teacher: What do we got, girls? What's going on here? 
[23:17] Student 1: In the first one, they start condensing, right? 
[23:18] Teacher: Yes, they do.
[23:19] Student 1: So it's just like seeing some of them are so condensed, but like some of them aren't... 
[23:23] Teacher: You can, you can, you can make that... definitely you can make that assumption and you can make that um happen. How would you... what would that look like? 
[23:31] Student 1: Well yeah, so...
[23:32] Teacher: So, yeah. So the thing is, remember we talked about this, this is a model, right? And so we don't know exactly what goes first. If there's if they're like okay there's four there let's number one goes first, and you go second, you go third... so when we say they start to condense, we're talking about how they're beginning to take that shape. You, in your mind, if you want to think of it as okay, one is starting and they don't all get done until prometaphase? Then you can do that. So you can show that there are some that are already that are organized, and then there are some that are still in this kind of spaghetti spaghetti bowl shape. 
[24:10] Teacher: What are you going to do with the cups? 
[24:11] Student 1: Oh, well, it's a cell.
[24:13] Teacher: Okay, that's, you can do that. Awesome, that works. Okay. So um as you're talking about this, I want you to draw what it is you're seeing. So you're seeing that chromosome one is condensed, and are they two separate pieces? 
[24:28] Student 1: What do you mean? 
[24:29] Teacher: So you have two cups, does that mean that there's they're two different like nuclear envelopes or different nuclei, or are you going to keep it like this? 
[24:36] Student 1: We're going to keep them like that until they separate. 
[24:38] Teacher: Okay, you want to... okay, just checking, just wondering. 
[24:41] Student 1: Is that right?
[24:42] Teacher: It is, right? Right. Because if they're all together... so I was thinking maybe if you used this as your nucleus and like that... but you guys can do whatever you want. So I was thinking that's in my mind, that's what I would do with it, but if you want to make this your whole cell like that, that's all good, somebody's just gonna have to hold it, right, to represent, to represent that that is in one nuclei, right. This are, this is all happening within only one. So I gave you two for a reason, but I'm not going to tell you why. 
[25:11] Student 1: Oh, or you could do it like that.
[25:12] Teacher: Cool. Okay, perfect, so draw what you see. Are we drawing in the first box or the second one?
[25:18] Student 1: Second one. Um, I don't know how to draw cups.
[25:21] Student 2: Oh, it's just a cup.
[25:23] Student 1: I don't know how to draw a cup! You could have just told me how to draw a cup. 
[25:29] Student 2: We're going to pretend like I know how to draw a cup. Okay, getting our spaghetti... what... what...
[25:40] Student 1: You could put that they are forming... they're confusing me on that one. We're going to make that.
[26:55] Student 3: That's it.
[26:56] Student 4: Alright, and then from right here they eventually split and they're two different... 
[27:03] Teacher: So, what are these two cups representing? 
[27:06] Student 3: The two cells.
[27:07] Teacher: The two cells. So you've already divided into two cells? 
[27:10] Student 3: Um, no, we're in prophase. 
[27:12] Teacher: You're in prophase. Okay, so then do we have two cells during prophase yet? 
[27:16] Student 3: No. 
[27:17] Teacher: So then what should you do? How should you model this properly so that you show only... ándale, there you go, perfect. Okay, so when you were asking me "what do what do they mean about what?" 
[27:27] Student 4: The two opposite poles.
[27:28] Teacher: Okay, so the two opposite ends, like what does it mean... so the ends of if this is one cell, we're talking about literally the ends are like the top and the bottom... yeah. So you can, yeah, you can move them with your hands... Yes ma'am.
[27:45] Student 1: So in the second one, it says that the nuclear envelope breaks... so would you put...
[27:54] Teacher: You could do that, you could do it like that, or you could completely take the cups out altogether. And say like okay the nuclear envelope is breaking and then the nuclear envelope is gone. So they don't have a container right, you could kind of say that it's hard with these, right, you can't say like let me crush, let me cut part of the cup out. Or I like how you thought about removing it that way. But essentially what it's saying is if this is starting to disappear. So that's why I gave you the cups so you could kind of visualize... you're doing a good job. Alright, so do we figure out where we're at next? 
[28:24] Student 1: Now we just need to have a little... 
[28:29] Student 5: They go away. So metaphase is just when it's going like the spindle... 
[28:35] Teacher: Miss? It uses the kinetochores form... what is this word... in each chromatid. So, like this? 
[28:40] Teacher: That's it, exactly. 
[28:42] Student 6: Then the centrosomes form the opposite sides of the nuclear area. 
[28:45] Teacher: So the centrosomes, we don't have um anything to represent it. Basically all that's going to mean is it's going to be like a structure that's going to start to um be become visible so that we... or it's going to become usable so that it can start moving these things around. So you can almost use this, like that, as the kinetochore or this. So it's just we don't have a piece for the model on that, and that's a... I'm glad that you pointed that out. Um but that's really what that means. It's it's saying that they're getting ready on each end so they can start moving things right, and getting them in place. These are the centrosomes? Those are the centrosomes, and the centrosomes are going to be part of the spindle that helps to, like I said, move everything around. So, but that's a great question, and that's missing from the model. Not a good model. 
[29:38] Student 4: So uh do we just draw accesses and then like dots on them?
[29:43] Student 3: Oh, because because it goes back to a little screw. Let me see on the two opposite kinetochores...
[29:51] Student 4: So whatever you got more down here?
[29:53] Student 3: Well I mean it just... okay yeah... they're right there together... they pull away from each other. So that makes sense. 
[30:09] Student 4: And it says here the... whatever you pronounce that, kinetochore... attach and move to the center. So then they just... I think they just uh prometaphase...
[30:27] Student 4: I'm just gonna draw an arrow saying that they're moving to the center.
[30:35] Student 3: Right there... the cytoplasm is separated, and so when they refer to the chromosomes being unfolded right? Okay, so that must just be what...
[31:09] Teacher: So when they're condensing, remember that they actually look, if they're coming out of looking like string, guys, remember they're having the same shape. So what, they should be two and two? So now they should basically, they should be already condensed, you should have four chromosomes that are ready...
[31:26] Student 7: No, they're like this, right? 
[31:29] Teacher: No, that is one, cuz remember they were twisted... so that... 'cause, look... it's like this, and there's two of them, right? And they're split into one and one, they pull apart. 
[31:42] Student 8: And the lines here they say "chromosomes" and not "chromatids."
[31:46] Teacher: It's still splitting it up. So right here... chromosomes are what? When they are combined. Yeah. Because then they're going to be able to be separated. 
[32:01] Student 8: Alright, keep going. 
[32:07] Student 7: What are we doing here... wait...
[32:15] Student 8: Or after that...
[32:16] Teacher: So I, so you guys really quickly, did you catch that like on the notes from nimsi that it says that in anaphase that the chromosomes are pulled apart? Okay, so yes, it does say chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles. And one thing that's missing from there is what? What's missing?
[32:32] Student: Chromatids.
[32:33] Teacher: Chromatids, exactly. So I'm glad you caught that, and I just want to make sure that you make a note of that, we're talking about when the chromosomes are pulled apart, they're pulled apart into their sister chromatids. I'll be right with you.
[32:45] Student 6: In telophase... 
[32:46] Teacher: Yep. And then they read, they unwind, they unwind again, and so when they unwind what is gonna happen?
[32:56] Student 6: But that's what I'm confused about.
[32:57] Teacher: That's where you're confused. Oh okay, that's okay. So then what happens, you're on you're on telophase, right? Okay so then it talks about how they are well we don't have that here, but if you notice let me show you here in telophase... they are pulled apart, you see how they're pulled apart to the opposite ends? And they stay unwound like that. So all we're doing is we're saying that the these kinetochores that are like fishing rods, fishing reels rather that are reeling them in, they bring them over and so they start, they're still unwound but they bring them over and they separate them. Okay. And then what happens? 
[33:38] Student 6: And then and then the nuclear envelope forms around.
[33:41] Teacher: Exactly. The nuclear envelope forms around them. And now what do we have? Well, they're kind of close together, right? And then what happens? What's our last phase? After telophase? Cytokinesis.
[33:55] Student 6: So what does it look like in your model? Show me with your cups. 
[34:00] Teacher: Okay. And that's... yep, two separate objects. Yup, exactly. Good job, girls.
[34:10] Student 8: Hold on, let me try...
[34:15] Teacher: All right, so... I went to every single table, I was so glad to see... I was so glad to see everybody modeling really, really well. Um, thank you so much for being so involved and so invested in this. We're going to go ahead and put this to rest today. Tomorrow we're going to keep talking a little bit more about this process. Um, thank you guys, you can put your materials down. You can go ahead and get ready to go.

## 2. BODY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS

Here is a detailed analysis of the teacher's body language throughout the ~36-minute video, broken down by key moments and overall patterns.

### **Chronological Body Language Analysis**

*   **[00:00 - 01:00] Initial Instructions & Setup**
    *   **Posture & Position:** The teacher stands at the front of the classroom, displaying an upright, open, and relaxed posture. She holds a presentation clicker in her right hand.
    *   **Gestures:** She uses her free left hand for open-palm gestures while speaking. At [00:24], she holds up a graphic organizer with both hands, pointing to specific sections to guide the students' attention.
    *   **Eye Contact:** She scans the room, making eye contact with various students as she gives instructions.
*   **[01:00 - 05:00] Reviewing Concepts**
    *   **Movement:** She paces comfortably back and forth at the front of the room.
    *   **Gestures:** Her hand gestures become more pronounced to emphasize key terms. At [02:04], she raises her hand high to prompt a show of hands from the class. At [03:22], she uses small, rapid hand movements to list off points.
    *   **Facial Expressions:** She smiles frequently, creating an approachable and encouraging atmosphere.
*   **[05:00 - 10:00] Introducing the Modeling Activity**
    *   **Props:** At [05:32], she brings out a large, colorful DNA model. She holds it up with both hands, manipulating it slightly to show its structure.
    *   **Movement:** She transitions from the front of the room to walking among the student tables.
    *   **Gestures:** At [06:08], she hands out materials (cups, pipe cleaners) while continuing to explain. At [07:59], she uses her fingers effectively to illustrate a concept: holding up one finger to represent a chromatid, then bringing two fingers together to represent a chromosome.
*   **[10:00 - 15:00] Explaining Prophase & Prometaphase**
    *   **Position:** She returns to the front to advance her slides and explain the next phases.
    *   **Gestures:** Her gestures are highly illustrative. At [10:09], she uses both hands to form a circle, mimicking a nuclear envelope encapsulating genetic material. At [11:34], she uses precise, small hand movements while explaining the breakdown of the envelope.
*   **[14:50 - 20:00] Explaining Metaphase, Anaphase, & Telophase**
    *   **Gestures:** At [14:55], she brings her hands together, palms facing inward, to visually represent chromosomes lining up in the middle of the cell during metaphase.
    *   **Gestures:** The most dramatic gesture occurs around [15:46] when explaining anaphase; she forcefully extends her arms out to her sides, mimicking the sister chromatids being pulled apart to opposite poles.
    *   **Movement:** She paces more actively while explaining these dynamic phases.
    *   **Gestures:** At [19:40], while discussing cytokinesis, she uses her hands to show the physical splitting of the cytoplasm.
*   **[20:00 - 22:00] Finalizing Instructions**
    *   **Posture:** She stands confidently at the front, summarizing the task.
    *   **Gestures:** She points to the board and uses open-handed gestures to wrap up the lecture portion before releasing the students to work independently.
*   **[22:00 - 36:27] Monitoring Group Work**
    *   **Movement:** For the remainder of the video, she is constantly moving from table to table.
    *   **Posture:** Her posture shifts dramatically. Instead of standing upright, she frequently leans over the tables ([22:28], [23:18], [24:26]) to get closer to the students' models. At [27:06], she rests her hand on the table and leans in closely to engage with a specific group.
    *   **Gestures:** She uses her hands continuously to point at the students' pipe-cleaner models, guide their placement, and re-explain concepts. At [33:35], she uses expressive hand gestures while clarifying a point to a group.
    *   **Eye Contact:** She maintains direct, focused eye contact with the small groups of students she is assisting, nodding to show she is listening and understanding their questions.

### **Body Language Patterns**

1.  **Illustrative Hand Gestures:** This is the most prominent feature of her body language. She rarely speaks without moving her hands. She uses them to physically manifest the biological processes she is describing (e.g., coiling, pulling apart, lining up, enclosing). This makes abstract microscopic concepts more visual for the students.
2.  **Dynamic Pacing:** During the lecture portions, she does not stand still behind a podium. She paces across the front of the room, which helps maintain student attention and projects high energy.
3.  **Proximity and Posture Shifts:** There is a clear distinction between her "lecturing posture" (upright, expansive) and her "facilitating posture" (leaning in, getting on the students' level). By physically closing the distance between herself and the students during group work, she makes herself more approachable and demonstrates active engagement with their progress.
4.  **Consistent Object Holding:** She consistently holds an object in her hand—initially a presentation clicker, and later a pen or marker. She uses these objects as extensions of her hand gestures to point or direct attention, rather than letting them become a distraction.

**06:53 - Praise / Feedback**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher checks on another group and says, "If you don't already know, Isaac and Sean have already created their first chromosome. Yeah, that was quick. There you go, thank you guys."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Positive reinforcement. She uses praise to motivate the students and highlight correct work to the rest of the class.

**07:07 - Praise / Observation**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher highlights different methods used by students: "Excellent, the ladies here have two chromosomes... Cassidy used the old-fashioned way... and Sophia used a little bead..."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Encouraging observation. She acknowledges and validates different ways of modeling the same concept.

**07:24 - Instruction / Checking for Understanding**
*   **Interaction:** She instructs the class to reverse the process: "Will you make them now just the chromatids? So show me the chromatids. There you go, undo 'em, yes."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Good pedagogical move. She tests their understanding of the vocabulary by having them physically deconstruct the model.

**07:42 - Feedback**
*   **Interaction:** Looking at a group's work, she says, "So you've got your chromatids. Excellent. Thank you."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Simple, positive reinforcement confirming they followed the instruction correctly.

*   **Quality/Nature:** Routine pacing check.

**16:20 - Check for Understanding**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher asks the whole class, "Alright, any questions so far?"
*   **Quality/Nature:** Routine check for understanding during the lecture portion.

**17:43 - Student Question / Clarification / Praise**
*   **Interaction:** A student (Valentina) asks, "So like the normal stage or style of the cell's DNA is not winded [coiled]?" The teacher responds enthusiastically, "Yep, exactly. That's a great question," and ensures the class hears the question. 
*   **Quality/Nature:** Excellent interaction. The teacher validates the student's critical thinking, confirms the correct understanding, and highlights the question's importance to the whole class.

**18:18 - Student Question / Clarification**
*   **Interaction:** Valentina follows up: "So then when it says that in G1 and S that the DNA uncoils, what is that?" The teacher clarifies that it means the DNA *remains* in that uncoiled state, rather than actively uncoiling at that moment.
*   **Quality/Nature:** Clear, helpful clarification that resolves a point of confusion regarding the wording in the notes.

**20:40 - Check for Understanding**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher asks, "Questions on cytokinesis or on anything about mitosis in these steps..."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Routine check for understanding before moving from lecture back to the modeling activity.

*   **Quality/Nature:** Prompt and polite response to a logistical need.

**23:17 - Prompting / Feedback**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher approaches a group to discuss how they are modeling prophase. The student says, "In the first one they start condensing..." The teacher affirms this and prompts them to think about how to best represent that transition with the materials.
*   **Quality/Nature:** Good scaffolding. She confirms their verbal understanding and challenges them to translate it into the physical model.

**24:11 - Question / Feedback**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher asks a group, "What are you going to do with the cups?" The student replies that the cup is a cell. The teacher validates this: "Okay, yes, you can do that. Awesome. That works."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Supportive interaction that encourages students to assign their own meaning to the provided materials.

**24:30 - Clarification**
*   **Interaction:** A student asks, "Are they two different nuclear envelopes or are you going to keep it like this?" The teacher clarifies that they will remain as one until they separate. 
*   **Quality/Nature:** Helpful clarification addressing the limitations and rules of the physical models they are building.

**27:04 - Guided Discovery / Correction**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher checks a group modeling prophase. She asks what the two cups represent, and the student says "Two cells." The teacher guides him to realize the error: "So you've already divided two cells? Now we're on prophase... do we have two cells during prophase yet?" The student realizes the mistake and puts the cups together. The teacher praises him: "Andale, there you go, perfect."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Excellent pedagogical interaction. Rather than just telling the student he is wrong, she asks guiding questions that allow him to identify and correct his own mistake.

**27:32 - Clarification**
*   **Interaction:** Continuing with the same group, the teacher explains what "opposite poles" means in the context of their cup model. 
*   **Quality/Nature:** Helpful connection bridging the abstract biological vocabulary with the physical manipulative.

**27:47 - Student Question / Suggestion**

**28:37 - Feedback / Clarification**
*   **Interaction:** A student points to his drawing and asks about kinetochores and centromeres. The teacher confirms he has it exactly right. He then asks about centrosomes. The teacher explains what they are and notes that they don't have a specific physical piece to represent them in their kits.
*   **Quality/Nature:** Informative and validating. She confirms accurate understanding and clearly explains a limitation of their physical model.

**29:20 - Clarification / Praise**
*   **Interaction:** A student points to the worksheet to clarify centrosomes. The teacher explains their role with the spindle fibers and adds, "That's a great question, and that's missing from the model..."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Continues to validate student inquiry while managing the constraints of the activity.

**33:23 - Observation / Feedback**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher observes a group working on anaphase. The student verbalizes their thought process: "I think they are... it's just saying that the chromosomes are pulled to opposite sides." The teacher listens and offers mild affirmation as they figure it out.
*   **Quality/Nature:** Passive, supportive observation. She allows the students the space to work through the logic themselves without interrupting.

**33:55 - Whole Class Correction / Praise**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher interrupts the class to ask if they caught an error on the presentation slide regarding anaphase. A student correctly points out that it says "chromosomes" but should say "chromatids." The teacher praises the student: "They're chromatids, exactly. I'm glad you caught that."
*   **Quality/Nature:** Excellent whole-class interaction. She uses a typo as a teachable moment to reinforce crucial, often-confused vocabulary and praises the students' sharp observation skills.

**34:27 - Student Confusion / Explanation / Visual Aid**
*   **Interaction:** A student expresses confusion about how the chromosomes "unwind" during telophase in their physical model. The teacher acknowledges the difficulty, says "I'll show you," and steps away to put a helpful diagram on the board.
*   **Quality/Nature:** Highly responsive teaching. She recognizes when a verbal explanation isn't enough and quickly provides a visual aid to support the student's understanding.

**35:05 - Guided Explanation**
*   **Interaction:** The teacher returns to the confused group and walks them through the end of telophase and cytokinesis step-by-step using their pipe cleaners and cups, asking prompting questions like "What happens next?" and "What's our last phase?" to ensure they understand the conclusion of the process.
*   **Quality/Nature:** Strong, guided support. She provides the necessary scaffolding to help the group successfully finish the modeling activity.

## 4-7. METRICS & TIMELINE

Here is a detailed analysis of the teaching video based on your requested criteria:

## STUDENT RESPONSE TIME
The teacher predominantly uses a lecture-style format mixed with hands-on modeling and small-group check-ins. During the whole-class portions, she relies heavily on rhetorical questions or physical gestures (like a show of hands) rather than verbal call-and-response. The clearest examples of measurable verbal Q&A occur during the small group work in the second half of the video.

Here are specific interactions:

*   **[12:21]** Question: "Did you guys have a hard time forming or separating your chromosomes?" (Whole class)
    *   **[12:26]** Response: Students collectively murmur "No."
    *   *Wait time: ~5 seconds*
*   **[23:18]** Question: "What's going on here?" (Small group)
    *   **[23:20]** Response: "In the first one they start condensing, right?"
    *   *Wait time: ~2 seconds*
*   **[27:05]** Question: "What are these two cups representing?" (Small group)
    *   **[27:07]** Response: "Two cells."
    *   *Wait time: ~2 seconds*
*   **[27:09]** Question: "So you've already divided two cells?" (Small group)
    *   **[27:10]** Response: "No, we're in prophase."
    *   *Wait time: ~1 second*
*   **[27:12]** Question: "...do we have two cells during prophase yet?" (Small group)
    *   **[27:16]** Response: "No."
    *   *Wait time: ~4 seconds*
*   **[27:24]** Question: "So when you were asking me what do they mean about what?" (Small group)
    *   **[27:28]** Response: "The two opposite poles."
    *   *Wait time: ~4 seconds*

**Average Student Response Time:** ~3 seconds. 
*(Note: Response times are naturally shorter in the small-group conversational setting compared to the whole-class instructional setting).*

## TEACHER SPEECH SPEED
The teacher maintains a brisk, upbeat, and consistent pace throughout the lesson, which is highly effective for keeping high school students engaged during a multi-step activity.

*   **[00:00 - 02:00] Instructions & Logistics (Fast: ~150-160 WPM):** The teacher speaks quickly while handing out materials, establishing the graphic organizer, and directing students on what to write down. 
*   **[02:00 - 06:00] Conceptual Review (Moderate: ~130-140 WPM):** When reviewing prior knowledge and discussing the difference between mitosis and meiosis, her pace slows down slightly. She is more deliberate, allowing students to process the foundational concepts.
*   **[06:00 - 12:00] Guided Modeling (Moderate/Variable: ~140 WPM):** The pace varies here as she gives an instruction, pauses to let them manipulate the pipe cleaners, and then resumes speaking.
*   **[12:00 - 21:00] Phase Lecture (Steady: ~140-150 WPM):** While going through the specific phases on the board, she speaks at a consistent, instructional pace, ensuring students have time to fill in their graphic organizers but keeping the momentum moving forward.
*   **[22:00 - 36:28] Small Group Check-ins (Conversational: ~130-150 WPM):** Her speed adapts to the students she is talking to. It is fluid, fast when confirming correct answers, and slower when correcting misconceptions.

## TEACHER SPEECH TONE
The teacher's tone is consistently positive, approachable, and highly encouraging. She creates a relaxed environment where students feel comfortable experimenting with the models.

*   **[00:00 - 02:00] Authoritative & Clear:** She establishes control of the room immediately, giving clear directives on organizing notes, but maintains a warm, welcoming pitch.
*   **[02:03 - 06:00] Engaging & Conversational:** She asks for a show of hands and reacts playfully to a student who hasn't learned the material before. Her tone is relatable (e.g., pointing out that humans would all look identical without meiosis).
*   **[06:00 - 12:00] Playful & Direct:** As they begin using the materials, she uses a fun, slightly dramatic tone ("Make me a pair!"). She is quick to offer positive reinforcement ("Perfect," "Excellent").
*   **[12:00 - 21:00] Instructional & Animated:** During the lecture portion, she avoids a monotone delivery by using animated vocal inflections and physical gestures. For example, at **[15:45]**, she uses a dramatic, humorous tone to describe sister chromatids being pulled apart ("No sister, don't leave me!").
*   **[22:00 - 36:28] Probing & Supportive:** While walking around the room, her tone shifts to a quieter, more inquisitive coaching style. She uses a guiding tone to help students self-correct (e.g., at **[27:12]** when helping a group realize they shouldn't be using two cups yet).
